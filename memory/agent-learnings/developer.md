# Developer Learnings

(QA appends to this file at the end of every feature retrospective.
Each entry is a lesson that generalizes beyond a single bug.)

## F03 -- Analytics Engine (2026-08-18)

- **Move all imports to the top of the file.** Inline `from datetime import timedelta` inside function bodies (indicators.py:117, 171) works but is inconsistent with the rest of the codebase. Top-level imports are easier to audit and follow PEP 8.
- **Add explicit tests for division-by-zero guards.** The `past_price == 0` guard in `compute_momentum` is correct but untested. When writing a guard clause, immediately write the test -- it serves as documentation of intent and prevents future regressions if the guard is accidentally removed.
